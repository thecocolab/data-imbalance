# [Class imbalance should not throw you off balance: Choosing the right classifiers and performance metrics for brain decoding with imbalanced data](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.18.500262)

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in cognitive, computational and clinical neuroscience. The reliable and efficient application of ML requires a sound understanding of its subtleties and limitations. Training ML models on datasets with imbalanced classes is a particularly common problem, and it can have severe consequences if not adequately addressed. With the neuroscience ML user in mind, this paper provides a didactic assessment of the class imbalance problem and illustrates its impact through systematic manipulation of data imbalance ratios in (i) simulated data and (ii) brain data recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our results illustrate how the widely-used Accuracy (Acc) metric, which measures the overall proportion of successful predictions, yields misleadingly high performances, as class imbalance increases. Because Acc weights the per-class ratios of correct predictions proportionally to class size, it largely disregards the performance on the minority class. A binary classification model that learns to systematically vote for the majority class will yield an artificially high decoding accuracy that directly reflects the imbalance between the two classes, rather than any genuine generalizable ability to discriminate between them. We show that other evaluation metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and the less common Balanced Accuracy (BAcc) metric â€“ defined as the arithmetic mean between sensitivity and specificity, provide more reliable performance evaluations for imbalanced data. Our findings also highlight the robustness of Random Forest (RF), and the benefits of using stratified cross-validation and hyperprameter optimization to tackle data imbalance. Critically, for neuroscience ML applications that seek to minimize overall classification error, we recommend the routine use of BAcc, which in the specific case of balanced data is equivalent to using standard Acc, and readily extends to multi-class settings. Importantly, we present a list of recommendations for dealing with imbalanced data, as well as open-source code to allow the neuroscience community to replicate and extend our observations and explore alternative approaches to coping with imbalanced data.

This repository contains the code to the analysis performed in the accompanying paper (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.18.500262).

- `pipeline.py` contains a generalizable pipeline for comparing classification metrics for different combinations of classifiers, sample size and class balance.
- `viz.py` contains a collection of visualization functions used to generate figures
- the `notebooks` directory contains code to run the experiments, using the pipeline (`pipeline.py`) and visualization functions (`viz.py`)

## Installation
First, create and activate a new Python environment:
```bash
conda create -n imbalance python==3.8 -y
conda activate imbalance
```
Afterwards, clone the repository and install its dependencies as follows:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:thecocolab/data-imbalance.git
cd data-imbalance
pip install -e .
```

### Reduced Installation
The `-e` flag allows you to make changes to the repository without the need to reinstall. If you are only planning to use the package and don't want to make changes you can skip cloning and install via
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thecocolab/data-imbalance.git
```

## Usage
The `Pipeline` class is the central piece of code for running experiments. It works with on binary classification datasets using scikit-learn classifiers, automatically testing different dataset sizes, class distributions and evaluates classification performance using a range of metrics. By default, 5-fold cross-validation will be used to increase robustness of the results but it is possible to adjust the cross-validation strategy when configuring the pipeline.

The general workflow of using the `Pipeline` class looks as follows:
```python
from imbalance.pipeline import Pipeline
from imbalance import viz

# load or generate dataset
x, y, groups = get_dataset(...)

# initialize pipeline
pl = Pipeline(x, y, groups,
              classifiers=["lda", "svm"],
              dataset_balance=[0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])
# fit and evaluate classifiers on dataset configurations
pl.evaluate()

# visualize classification scores
viz.metric_balance(pl)
```
Note that `x` and `y` are the only required arguments to instantiate a `Pipeline`.

## The `Pipeline` API
- **`x` (required):** The dataset used for training and evaluating the classifiers. It can be a 1D array for single-feature classification or a 2D matrix with size `num-samples x num-features`. The array should contain floats suitable for classification, meaning that any kind of preprocessing or normalization should be applied before passing it to the pipeline.
- **`y` (required):** The classification labels corresponding to the samples given by `x`. This should be a one-dimensional integer-array where each unique integer represents a different class. Currently, only binary classification is implemented so `y` should be made up of exactly two unique integers (e.g. 0 and 1).
- **`groups` (optional, default=`None`):** An array with the same shape as `y`, containing group labels for each sample where each group corresponds to a unique integer (e.g. one group per subject). This will be used by the cross-validation strategy to avoid bias due to group effects. If left as `None`, the cross-validation will not take groups into account.
- **`classifiers` (optional, default=`"lr"`):** Can be a string with the name of a classifier, an instantiated scikit-learn classifier or a list, potentially mixing strings and classifier objects. To instantiate the classifier from a string, its name must be present in `Pipeline.CLASSIFIERS.keys()`.
- **`cross_validation` (optional, default=`StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)`):** An instantiated scikit-learn cross-validation strategy. By default, 5-fold cross-validation will be used. If `groups` is not `None`, the group-aware variant of k-fold cross-validation is used.
- **`dataset_balance` (optional, default=`np.linspace(0.1,0.9,25)`):** A list of imbalance ratios that should be tested. Ratios should be larger than zero and smaller than one. A value of zero corresponds to a dataset made up fully of class 0, a balance value of 0.5 corresponds to a perfectly balanced dataset (50% of class 0 and 50% of class 1) and a balance of one corresponds to a dataset made up fully of class 1.
- **`dataset_size` (optional, default=`"full"`):** Can be either `"full"` or a list of ratios (`0 < x <= 1`). The value `"full"` is equivalent to `dataset_size=[1.0]`, which evaluates the complete dataset. Values between zero and one artificially limit the number of samples, allowing to check effects related to dataset size.
- **`n_permutations` (optional, default=`100`):** The number of permutations to run for evaluating statistical significance using permutation tests. A value of zero does not run permutation tests. Note that permutations will only be computed for the first initialization (if n_init > 1).
- **`random_seed` (optional, default=`42`):** The random seed to use.
- **`n_init` (optional, default=`10`):** Number of re-initializations of the whole pipeline.

After calling `pl.evaluate()` on a `Pipeline` object, the nested dictionary `pl.scores` contains all results. The dictionary is structued in the following way:
```python
pl.scores = {
    # dataset balance ratio
    0.3: {
        # dataset size ratio
        0.5: {
            # classifier name
            "clf1": {
                # metric name
                "metric1": (mean_score-metric1, std_score-metric1, p-value-metric1, permutation_score_metric1),
                "metric2": (mean_score-metric2, std_score-metric2, p-value-metric2, permutation_score_metric2),
                ...
            },
            "clf2": ...
        },
        0.7: ...
    },
    0.5: ...
}
```
